# image_generator_microservice

As part of the CS361 portfolio project, a microservice is created to provide an image service for one of my team mates. 
This server is hosted to heroku as an app and could be accessed by the user through an url and fetch images by calling the url.
The microservice will provide a list of medical images that my team mate can call and use on their apps.
